This was programmed during the Yale Hackathon between March 30th and 31st 2024.

## Inspiration

America is currently facing a crisis in chronic student absenteeism. We wanted to tackle this problem by increasing engagement in students to bring them back to school.

## What it does

This is an educational app designed by Aleks Jacewicz, Rory McClenahan, Lewis Chao, and Gavin Horning-Kane to increase engagement and facilitate discussion among students. It is designed to split a class into three groups. Two groups will create a presentation and then the third group will judge the presentations and vote on the best group. During the presentation the first two groups will have to defend their presentation and answer questions. This will incentivize both discussion and collaboration, especially during this crisis of chronic absenteeism. 

The app also allows teachers to create the docs that the groups use and also observe all the students. The teacher can also manage the groups, allowing them to reassign students if they need to.

## How we built it
We used React, PHP, and MySql
