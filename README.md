# socratic-circle

This is an educational app designed by Aleks Jacewicz, Rory McClenahan, Lewis Chao, and Gavin Horning-Kane  to increase engagement among students.
It is designed to create 3 groups in a class. Two groups create a presentation and then the third group judges the last group and votes on the best group. This will incentivize both discussion and collaboration, especially during this crisis of chronic absenteeism. It also allows teachers to create the docs that the groups use and also observe all the students. The teacher can also manage the groups, allowing them to reassign students if they need to.

LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.
